					Hello folks,<br>It's me <b>Aswin Reji</b> a biomedical engineer and an information security enthusiastic from Kerala, India.Hope you all stay safe.<br>
					( This is my first blog,Please forgive my mistakes in this blog, if any)<br> <br><b><p class="posttitle" style="color:green">INTRODUCTION :-</P> </b>As you all know COVID-19 has become a pandemic, affecting more than 200+ 
						countries throughout the world .The COVID-19 outbreak not only threatens global public health but also impacts many other aspects of life, COVID-19 has emerged as a pandemic with serious clinical manifestations including death. 
						While tremendous efforts at the frontline are placed on detecting the virus, providing treatments, and developing vaccines, it is also critically important to examine the technologies and systems for tackling disease emergence and 
						especially the strategy for disease prevention. The most spreading of this pandemic is due to the direct contact with an infected patient. </b><br><br><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*blcj_onMM27TDIDf" alt="Covid" width="50%" height="auto"><br>

<br><p>Fast spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has raised huge challenges for global healthcare systems .And also food,medicine delivery and monitoring patient health condition is huge challange face by health workers.The most spreading of this pandemic is due to the  direct contact with an infected patient.
	 The virus that  causes covid 19 is mainly transmitted through droplets  generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes or  exhales.</p>
	 <p>
		At this time we are introducing a robotic medical assistant called <b>"COVID-19 PATIENT AID"</b>.The robots can be deployed in isolation wards for COVID-19 infected cases for delivery of food and medicine to patients, Monitoring health, and collection of contagious waste .
		 The robot distributes medicines and foods to COVID-19 patients inside a COVID-19 ward and disinfects themselves before returning to a health worker who stays in a green zone. The health worker can control the robot from a safe distance and see real-time data on the PATIENT AID'S WEBSITE .
		  The robot is equipped with multi-sensors With a large-capacity tray, the bot can deliver lots of medicines, meals, and other supplies to patients in the hospital to reduce the burden on the medical staff. An advantage of it is that the health workers can avoid going to red zones wearing PPE kits 
		  in a Covid treatment centre. After serving the patients foods and medicine, the robot can be disinfected inside a tend through a fogging method </p>

	 <br><p class="posttitle" style="color:green">WHY PATIENT AID? </P>
		<p>The most spreading of this pandemic is due to the direct contact with an infected patient. The virus that causes covid 19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. Using our robot, the direct contact of medical practitioners and covid 19 isolated patients can be neglected.
			 The major features of this device are pulse and temperature monitoring of patients, delivering food and drugs to the patients, providing sanitizer, and also health care workers can see patient pulse rate and temperature in patient aide web dashboard. A large number of hospitals are seeking the help of Robotics out of an urgent need for non-contact delivery 
			 and health monitoring of covid patients. They can reduce contact between people and effectively prevents the spread of the virus. And also reduce the cost of purchasing PPE kits.</p>
			 <br><p class="posttitle" style="color:green">HOW IT'S WORKS? </P>

				<p>It is a remote control robot and its movement controlled by a remote,and the 2 sensors ,  Pulse Sensor and LM35 Temperature Sensors measure BPM &  Temperature respectively. The Arduino processes the code and displays it to  LCD Display. ESP8266 Wi-Fi module connects to Wi-Fi and sends the data to patient aide server.Finally, the data can be monitored from any part of the world by logging into the patient aid website.</p>

				<br><br><p class="posttitle" style="color:green">FEATURES :- </P>

<p><li> Remote Food AND Medicine Delivery</li>

	<li>Real Time Temperature Monitoring</li>
	
	<li>Real Time Pulse Monitoring</li>
	
	<li>Automated Sanitization</li></p><br>
	<P>This device is portable and cost effective. It is a very efficient system and very easy to handle, provides great flexibility and serves as a great improvement over other conventional monitoring system and safely distribute food and medicine</p>
<br><p>"The future Robot together with AI could revolutionize individual care by providing a better quality of life."</p>
